<h1>Engineering at PBS</h1>

<h2>What brings you here?</h2>

<p>Do you want to learn about the engineering team that delivers over 2,000,000
video streams a week? Are you interested in working on that team? Then
you're at the right place.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>PBS uses media to "<a href="http://www.pbs.org/about/about-pbs/mission-statement/">educate, inspire, entertain and express a diversity of perspectives</a>". At PBS Digital we try to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>PBS Digital engineers make products that deliver videos that have an impact on our audiences. Children are more prepared for school through PBS KIDS programs. Adults learn and enjoy our content spanning genres like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Arts & Culture</li>
  <li>Drama</li>
  <li>Science & Nature</li>
  <li>History</li>
  <li>Independent Films</li>
  <li>News & Public Affairs</li>
</ul>

<p>We're the engineering team that delivers this life-changing media. We do it every day for people across the United States.</p>

<h2>Engineering Precepts</h2>

<p>We're a small team responsible for big projects. Given these constraints we've adopted some core principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bias toward action</li>
  <li>Collegiality</li>
  <li>Curiosity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bias toward action</h2>

<p>PBS Digital engineers build products for people. Our motivation is to ship code to people with consideration to speed and stability. We are autonomous and often rely on self-determination to pass through ambiguity.</p>

<h2>Collegiality</h2>

<p>Like PBS' media means to "educate, inspire, entertain and express a diversity of perspectives" so do our engineers. These are qualities we foster in our interactions with each other. We create a place where people value 
  psychological safety and encourage experimentation.</p>

<h2>Curiosity</h2>

<p>PBS engineers continuously pursue mastery of their craft. We work closely with their counterparts in product development. Our cross-functional teams include engineers, designers, and product managers.</p>

<h2>What Next?</h2>

<p>Does the above sound like a purpose you could get behind? Are you a software engineer interested in a new opportunity? You can apply for one of our open positions at the links below:</p>
